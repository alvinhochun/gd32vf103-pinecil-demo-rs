Demo 03 - Read button input and blink LED using the HAL crate
===

In this demo, we blink an LED connected to the TX pin on the breakout board,
same as the previous two demos. In addition, we also read button input, and
depending on the button states we change the LED lighting pattern.

The Pinecil has two buttons ('+' and '-') built into it, which this demo
utilizes.
