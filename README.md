Pinecil GD32VF103 RISC-V Rust Demos
===

My personal collection of Rust demos running on the [PINE64 Pinecil][pinecil]
portable soldering iron, featuring a GD32VF103TBU6 Risc-V microcontroller.

I do not guarantee the correctness of any code in this repository.

How to use
---

### Prerequisite

Obviously you'll need a Pinecil and a computer, and the USB Type-C cable to
connect the two.

A not-too-outdated Rust compiler is expected. I am using rustc 1.50.0.

You need to add the relevant Rust compiler target:

```
$ rustup target add riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
```

You will also need a GNU binutils `objcopy` capable of producing a raw binary
file from an ELF file for flashing. Generally any `objcopy` tools should work,
but I've mostly been using `riscv-nuclei-elf-objcopy` from the Nuclei RISC-V
toolchain.

At last, you will need a tool to flash the resulting binary onto the device.
If you have ever updated the firmware of your Pinecil, you should already have
such a tool.

#### Optional goodies

- An official Pinecil breakout board is strongly recommended since it allows
  you to connect the UART and/or a JTAG debugger.
- A device to connect to the 3.3V UART is needed to make use of the UART, such
  as a USB to UART adapter, a single board computer like Raspberry Pi, or even
  an Arduino. Beware that if using a 5V UART device, you should not connect the
  TX pin of your device to the RX pin of the Pinecil directly, as the RX pin on
  the Pinecil is not 5V-tolerant. You can use a resistor voltage divider to
  convert the voltage level.
- It may be nice to have a debugging setup using a JTAG debugger, however I have
  not tried one myself. If you use a JTAG, you probably also want OpenOCD and
  GDB.
- An LED and a current-limiting resistor can be used to provide a binary
  output, as a simple indicator, or just to get started with a simple blinking
  LED demo.
- Jumper wires with DuPont connectors to connect the pins, and a breadboard
  to go with it.
- A multimeter is almost necessary for any electronics work.
- A digital oscilloscope or a logic analyzer can also come in handy.

### Running the demos

Building a demo is simple. This:

```
$ cargo build -p demo-00-blinky-raw-pointer --release
```

... will build the demo "00-blinky-raw-pointer" and produce the ELF file
`target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/demo-00-blinky-raw-pointer`.

To produce a flashable firmware binary, use `objcopy`:

```
$ riscv-nuclei-elf-objcopy -O binary target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/demo-00-blinky-raw-pointer firmware.bin
```

The resulting `firmware.bin` can be flashed with `dfu-util` or the
"GD32 Dfu Tool". The official [firmware updater][updater] is also capable of
flashing the file, since it uses `dfu-util` under the hood.
